Hi, I'm Camaron Mangham.

I’m an AI & Data Systems Architect and all-around tech enthusiast. I’m always exploring new ideas, whether it’s building AI-driven systems, expanding my home lab, or diving deeper into data, security, and automation.

Currently, I’m obsessed with AI, cybersecurity, and engineering robust data systems. I love working on interesting projects and talking about tech in general. Let’s connect!
