## What inspired this new project?
A while back (about a year ago) I made a couple of genAI projects while I was on the job search. Both were developed with [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and Streamlit and can be viewed here:
- [Cover Letter Generator](https://github.com/clmangham/cover_letter_generator) on that I shared as a [Streamlit app](https://clmangham.streamlit.app/Cover_Letter_Generator)
- [AI chatbot](https://github.com/clmangham/SME_LLM) for trending research papers from paperswithcode.com.

*Simple front-end for cover letter generator, built with Streamlit*.

While looking for new job roles (again) I've been considering AI tools that can help in my day to day. 
## So what's the big idea?
The problem is that while applying for a varied job titles, with diverse job descriptions (*Data Scientist, Data engineer, ML engineer, GenAI engineer, et cetera*), across different industries, it can be difficult to think of the best ways to be successful my job search. 

The (*not so big*) idea is to capture relevant data from my job search and use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG - commonly discussed as GenAI) and cleverly crafted prompts to aid with digesting this information. 

**The initial goal develop this process that captures data and pipes it to my new AI assistant.** 

In the future I'd plan to deploy this and any other AI service with my home lab, so I have access to them from anywhere.
## Frameworks, and models
I'm familiar with Langchain, so I'll be sticking with that. As for models, I have primarily used OpenAI's GPT models, but I am considering what other models I could use locally, for example, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

I'll do some research on local models, but I'm generally excited to see what kind of output comes from this.
